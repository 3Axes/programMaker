# ProgramMaker

Well, initially it was a project that I just stalled on.
Then I finished it as a school project and thought I'd add it on GitHub.

Because Python saves files with no extra encoding (you can open it with notepad to see the same text), creating a string inside a program and then saving it externally to a file with no extra encoding would basically yield a Python file (adding the .py).
