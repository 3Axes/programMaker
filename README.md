# ProgramMaker

Well, initially it was a project that I just stalled on.
Then I finished it as a school project and thought I'd add it on GitHub.

Because Python saves files with no extra encoding (you can open it with notepad to see the same text), creating a string inside a program and then saving it externally to a file with no extra encoding would basically yield a Python file (adding the .py).

So right now, it's really basic. If I get extra time here and there, I'll try and add functionality (like being able to add code into an if/elif/else directly from the program).
